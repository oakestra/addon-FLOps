\chapter{Additional FL Research Paper Analysis}\label{appendix:fl_research}
The following two tables (\ref{table:additional_fl_research_table_1}, \ref{table:additional_fl_research_table_2}) refer to the omitted FL papers that we examined for FLOps.
The main part can be found here (\ref{table:main_fl_research_table}).

Table \ref{table:additional_fl_research_table_1} shows the first half of the remaining FL papers and
table \ref{table:additional_fl_research_table_2} depicts the second half.
When there is no content (-) in the "Limitations \& Future Work" column that means that the 
authors did not mention any explicitly and that we did not notice anything specifically.
