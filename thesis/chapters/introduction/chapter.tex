\chapter{Introduction}

The number of smart devices has been rapidly growing in the last several years.
Improvements in connectivity (Cloud Computing \& Internet of Thingsâ€”IoT), connection speeds (5G),
and computing power enable this increasing fleet of edge/mobile devices to generate enormous amounts of data (BigData).
Combined with the expansion of AI/ML, this data is a driving factor for current successful workflows and future advancements.
This complementing union of technologies plays a key role in elevating various domains,
from agriculture and healthcare to education and the security sector, to Industry 4.0 and beyond (Industry 5.0).
Diverse and complex challenges arise from this swiftly evolving landscape. \cite{paper:ai_edge_iot_review}
