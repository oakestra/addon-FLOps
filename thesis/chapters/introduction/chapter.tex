% BigData + Industry X.0 + 5/6G, etc -> more data -> boom in AI/ML

During the last several years the number of smart devices has been rapidly growing.
The impressive improvements in the domains of connectivity, connection speeds, computing power,
enable this ever-increasing swarm of machines (IoT, edge-devices, mobiles, etc.) to generate a huge amount of data.
Combined with the exponential growth of AI/ML this data is a driving factor for further improvements.
Diverse and complex challenges arise from this rapidly evolving landscape.
