% novel open-source "proof-of-concept" foundational work to 
% enable real FL (not simulations) to be used/developed/tested 
% in an automated way - including orchestration
% users do not even need expert knowlege of FL (or how to set it up / configure)
% they simply provide ML code that has to "match" a specific structure
% the rest gets automated for the user
% including building a containerized image - FL env
% which wrapps the original (data-less) ML code with all necessary FL tooling
% to enable FL + handles dependency-management to have a proper image with best practices
% (try to be as light-weight as possible) - many users might lack know-how how to containerize their ML code
% and especially do this well - how to handle dependencies, etc.

% automated orchestration & handling of all FL components for the user
% provide SOTA GUI (mlflow) MLOps tooling to observer progress in real-time
% analyse progress - safe/export/store/share findings, metrics, trained model

% support HFL (first-ever via Flower)
% (mix of FL + MLflow)

% support for multi-platform (edge)

% first ever FLOps software

% allows to automatically build an inference server/service based on the trained model
% and deploy it to test/use it straight away

% On top of all that "Dev"Ops - big focus on making the development of this "foundational system"
% easy - high code quality - automatic - ready made services & images (Mock Data Provider, Inference Reference Service)
% (also base-images for faster development cycles)
% + new Oakestra CLI to interact with this very easily 

% maybe merge in "Objectives" chapter from BA in here
% i.e. start with what were we intended to do and what did we do to resolve that?
