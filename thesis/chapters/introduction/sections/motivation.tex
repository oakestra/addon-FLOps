\section{Motivation}

Let's imagine the mentioned problems could be resolved. What difference would it make?
If we invision a universally trusted and used standard tool or set of tools for doing FL,
similar to what Docker or Kubernetes have become. 
This tool would allow researchers, developers, and end-users to easily
set up, perform, reproduce, experiment everything FL related.
This would not only reduce the necessary level of expert knowledge in this field and related ones
but also accelerate existing workflows.
FL could be adapted and used by more people in more areas.
By the power of automating tedies and error-prone tasks the current and future progress of FL connected work could be accelerated.
