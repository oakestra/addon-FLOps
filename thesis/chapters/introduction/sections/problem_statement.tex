\section{Problem Statement}

With great access to data comes great responsibility that can be easily exploited.
Many of the aforementioned machines are personal user devices that store and handle sensitive private data.
In Classical Machine Learning data gets send from client devices to a server where for training the ML model or performing inference serving.
This enables direct access to this sensitive data as well as the power to trace it back.
Thus creating a breach of privacy.

Governments and organisations have put laws and regulations in place to prohibit such potential abuse.

Federated Learning (FL) is one possible solution to still be able to utilize sensitive data.
Instead of collecting the data on a server and training ML models there the training occurs directly on the client devices.
Afterwards the individually trained models get send to the server who combines the collected models into a single global one.
This global model can be then distributed to the clients again for further training cycles.
Therefore enabling a way to train a shared global model on sensitive data while keeping the sensitive data secure on the local client devices.

Because FL is a rather modern technique it lacks in regards of being easy to set up and utilize.
It lacks sophisticated tooling to increase ease of access and use.
There is a lot of research being done in the realm of FL.
The majority of researchers in this field focus on improving existing FL components, strategies, and algorithms or inventing better alternatives.
Is is very rare to see work that focuses on the actual initial setup, deployment, or improvment of usability of FL.
As a result contributing in the field of FL or simply reproducing findings is a task that ranges from non-trivial to completely undocumented blackbox, thus not reproducable.
Instead of using common tooling to catalyze one's work to be able to quicker get started with doing new novel work.
One needs to reinvent the wheel of how to setup and manage one's FL.
I.e. There is a big lack of unity and automation in the realm of FL.

So FL is lacking the bare-bone tools to easily work on it - not even to mention more advanced techniques to increase productivity and effectiveness that other domains are already using for ages.
