% Background Flow - how ideas are interconnected 
% + good place to mention resources I used (mostly papers, etc.)
% How the idea of FLOps came to be + motivation
% BigData + Industry X.0 + 5/6G, etc -> more data -> boom in AI/ML
% conflict with privacy & laws & regulations -> FL
% FL - Basics (as a solution for laws & privacy)
% FL - focus (especially in research) on complex algo optimization etc - neglect of making this easy to use - accessible
% -> discuss similar problem with ML -> raise of MLOps
% To understand/explain MLOps one needs to understand DevOps
% One of the key things in devops is automation & ease-of use
% for the developer/development or end-user 
% CLI, pipelines, containerization (anywhere-anytime)
% manage all these moving FL components - need orchestration
% FL primarily focused on edge - use edge friendly orchestrator
% -> Oakestra

% Still need a place to put motivation (where to motivate showcase problems -> most likely here (?))
% also still need a place to discuss Related Works (the few quite similar ones)
