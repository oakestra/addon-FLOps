\section{Federated Learning}\label{section:federated_learning}

This section starts with the fundamental building blocks and terminologies of FL.
FLOps is orchestrated via Oakestra \cite{paper:oakestra_usenix}, which uses an unconventional
three-tiered structure that allows support for geographical clusters.
We have the opportunity to benefit from this unique composition and apply FL to it.
To do so, we investigate more advanced concepts in FL, focusing on different FL architectures.

With this solid FL understanding, we review the research landscape of FL.
We look at active and popular research directions and point out under-explored aspects,
and weak points.
We briefly look at FL in industry.
Followed by a detailed comparison of existing FL frameworks and libraries.
We conclude the section on FL by providing an overview of Flower \cite{flower_docs}, our FL framework of choice.
