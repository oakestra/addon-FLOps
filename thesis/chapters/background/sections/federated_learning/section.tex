\section{Federated Learning}\label{section:federated_learning}

This section starts with the fundamental building blocks and terminologies of FL,
followed by a section showcasing vital supplementary FL concepts.
FLOps is orchestrated via Oakestra \cite{paper:oakestra_usenix}, which uses an unconventional
three-tiered structure that allows support for geographical clusters.
We have the opportunity to benefit from this unique composition and apply FL to it.
To do so, we investigate more advanced concepts in FL, focusing on different FL architectures.

With this solid FL understanding, we review the research landscape of FL.
We look at active and popular research directions and point out under-explored aspects,
and weak points.
Followed by a detailed comparison of existing FL frameworks and libraries.
We conclude the section on FL by providing an overview of Flower \cite{flower_docs}, our FL framework of choice.

We base the majority of the first three subsections
(FL basics, supplementary FL concepts, and FL architectures) on the 2022 book
'Federated Learning - A Comprehensive Overview of Methods and Applications' \cite{book:fl}.
It captures and discusses the history and progress of FL research and state-of-the-art FL techniques (up to 2022).
