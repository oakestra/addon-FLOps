\subsection{FL Frameworks \& Libraries}\label{subsection:fl_frameworks_and_libraries}

To better comprehend why so many researchers do not specify or use FL frameworks we take a look
at the current landscape of available FL frameworks.

We will keep this discussion short because this master's thesis \cite{thesis:tum_fl_framework_comparison}
from 2023 already analyzed and evaluated FL frameworks in great detail.

In his thesis the author examines FL libraries, frameworks, and benchmarks.
He finds that many FL tools exist for very specific niche use cases and architectures.
Which is contrary to the opinions of his questioned FL practitioners and experts that
expect FL libraries and framework to focus on basic FL features,
such as communication, aggregator-learner orchestration, security, and data aggregation.
The author acknowledge the large number of libraries and frameworks, where most
are not not production-ready and still in a experimental research state.
To reduce complexity the author decided to focus on five most promising open source frameworks.
For a framework to be allegeable it needed to fulfill 2/3 of the following criteria.
It needs to have more then one thousand starts and 350 forks on GitHub.
The interviewed experts had to mentioned it.
The framework has to be supported on all major operation systems.

Because FL is rapidly evolving we updated the findings and expanded upon them by including when
the last version was released, when last commit was pushed, and how many open issues the repository has.

Table \ref{table:updated_fl_framework_comparison} shows the updated FL Framework comparison.
Note that we took these stats on the 16.08.2024.
The FL frameworks are actively developed. 
Only FedML has not been updated for several months now.
