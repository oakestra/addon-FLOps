% research has been focused on optimizing FL algos
% comming up with new algos
% optimizing bottlenecks
%
% briefly mention the following aspects to highlight that FL is a complex topic with lots of things people are working on
% "Client-Side Local Training" - Computation, Memory, Energy, Network
% mention Security/Privacy

% Lack of papers discussing how to set-up, manage, orchestrate FL in the first place
% rarely talk how they set up their experiments
% rarely mention what they use for FL or even for ML
% very hard - intransparent - to reproduce, etc.

%Mention a hand-ful of papers here and there what they are looking into to signal that hey I did my research and reading

Figure \ref{fig:fl_documents_research} shows the exponential growth of FL documents
since 2016. (This data comes from searching for "federated learning" in article title, abstract or keywords via Scopus \cite{scopus_homepage}.)
Note that we based the idea for this graph on \cite{thesis:tum_fl_framework_comparison}
and we used a different query with the latest available data.

Before we started working on FLOps we wanted to find research gaps in the fields of 
ML at the edge, specifically FL.
In total we have read and examined 47 papers in detail. 
26 papers were focused on FL. 
Additionally, we consulted several articles,
joined and participated in discussion forums,
and completed a couple of payed courses \cite{udemy_homepage}.

TODO TODO 
I think this is a great idea, the graphs and table
I would only feature the most important once in the graph and table.
The rest should be placed in the appendix (will still provid from huge reference list)

        Likely the first paper to combine PFL with HFL in a three-tiered structure.
        Proves mathematically that this approach works and converges.
        Includes many interesting insights regarding the HPFL.

        Proposes a novel cluster-based secure aggregation strategy for diverse nodes.
        Clustering based on processing score \& GPS information/latency.
        Leads to better throughput.
        Reduces false-positive dropouts.
        Introduces a novel additive sharing-based masking scheme that is robust against dropouts.

        Assumes that all participants are honest - does not evaluated what happens with malicious users.
        Server might become a bottleneck - can be resolved by using HFL (with cluster heads).
        Only image classification was checked, no other ML task.
