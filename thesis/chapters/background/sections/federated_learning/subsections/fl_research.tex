% also talk briefly about FL history (that it is rather young)
% mention spike of research (update graph from Master Thesis of other TUM student)
% research has been focused on optimizing FL algos
% comming up with new algos
% optimizing bottlenecks
%
% briefly mention the following aspects to highlight that FL is a complex topic with lots of things people are working on
% "Client-Side Local Training" - Computation, Memory, Energy, Network
% mention Security/Privacy

% Very briefly mentioned Personalized FL -> allude that this will be discussed in "Future Work"
%
% Lack of papers discussing how to set-up, manage, orchestrate FL in the first place
% rarely talk how they set up their experiments
% rarely mention what they use for FL or even for ML
% very hard - intransparent - to reproduce, etc.
%
%Mention a hand-ful of papers here and there what they are looking into to signal that hey I did my research and reading
