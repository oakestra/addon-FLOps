\section{Machine Learning Operations}

In section \ref{subsection:fl_research}, we discovered and discussed the gaps in the
FL research field in terms of deployment, automation, orchestration, and usability.
To improve upon these aspects and benefit the field,
we first need to investigate modern best practices.

Patterns emerged during the history of applying computer science to solve problems and develop solutions.
This includes various software engineering techniques and models.
Famous examples are the waterfall model or agile development, such as Scrum.
They all share the same goal of delivering high-quality, production-ready software.
Over the last decades, a plethora of contrasting and intertwined disciplines have emerged 
that need to cooperate smoothly to develop, deliver, and operate modern software.
One can group these tasks into two broad categories: development and operation.
