\section{System Models}

After eliciting and specifying requirements, this section presents scenarios and analysis models representing how the system satisfies these requirements.
These models aim to improve the comprehension of FLOps on the application level instead of the solution one.
The models do not depict concrete implementation.
Instead, they show a simplified conceptual representation of FLOps' architecture and workflows.
This includes involved components and their relationships.
These are not identical to the actual implementation.
The goal is to improve comprehension of the system instead of showing overwhelmingly verbose intricate details that might change in future updates.

System models aim to build what is called an analysis model.
The analysis model has three distinct parts
The scenarios and use cases form the functional model.
Class and object models make the analysis object model.
State machines and sequence diagrams create the dynamic model of the system. \cite{book:bruegge}
