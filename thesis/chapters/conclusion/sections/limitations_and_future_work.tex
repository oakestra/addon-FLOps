\section{Limitations \& Future Work}
% % LIMITATIONS %% 
% Build-times
% Dependency Hell (Build/MLflow,etc)
% Occasional Flakiness due to implementation (new to pydantic)
% Evaluated primarily on Monolith machine - the resources could be analyzed in greater detail (per container/service) remove host,etc traffic/consumption


% % FUTURE WORK %% 
% GPU
% Personalized FL
% Extended/Modified HFL
% More FL - diff directions - diff algos
% More ML Frameworks & Datasets Experiments
% Experimentation with edge focused ML frameworks, PI, etc (multi-platform/edge)
% More automation via more CLI integration, etc
% Integrate with Mahmouds work
