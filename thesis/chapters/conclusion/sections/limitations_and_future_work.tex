\section{Limitations \& Future Work}
% Build-times (mention experimental new build tools (slim, nydus, etc.))
% Dependency Hell (Build/MLflow,etc)
% Occasional Flakiness due to implementation (new to pydantic)



% Security & Privacy 
% GPU
% Personalized FL <- mention papers here (make an introduction here)
% Extended/Modified HFL
% More FL - diff directions - diff algos
% More ML Frameworks & Datasets Experiments
% Experimentation with edge focused ML frameworks, PI, etc (multi-platform/edge)
\subsection{Federated Learning via FLOps}

% More automation via more CLI integration, etc
% Integrate with Mahmouds work
% Evaluated primarily on Monolith machine - the resources could be analyzed in greater detail (per container/service) remove host,etc traffic/consumption
\subsection{Complementary Components \& Integrations}
