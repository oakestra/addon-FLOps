\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter:conclusion}

This chapter provides a verdict of the currents state of FLOps including its limitations and how FLOps can be improved in the future.

FLOps was created to fill the gaps of automation, orchestration, and usability of the FL field.
It successfully achieved its objectives.
It makes FL more accessible to users of any prior level of expertise in FL and helps them to benefit from the automation found in the domains of MLOps and orchestration.
It embraces flexibility by allowing various frameworks, datasets, ML repositories to be used for training via configurable projects.
Due to this simplicity and easy access for users and lack of virtualization FLOps prioritizes tangible FL applications.
