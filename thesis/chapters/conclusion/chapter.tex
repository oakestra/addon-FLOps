\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter:conclusion}

We created FLOps to fill the gaps in automation, orchestration, and usability in the field of FL.
It successfully achieved its objectives.
It makes FL more accessible to users regardless of their level of expertise and helps them benefit from the automation found in MLOps and orchestration.
It embraces flexibility by allowing various frameworks, datasets, and ML repositories to be used for training via configurable projects.
Due to this simplicity, easy user access, and multi-platform containerization, FLOps prioritizes tangible FL applications.
