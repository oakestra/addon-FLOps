\chapter{Implementation Details}

After discussing requirements and simplified system models, this chapter discloses significant details of the implementation that powers FLOps.
We implemented FLOps mainly in Python.
Our goal is to use state-of-the-art tools for FLOps' implementation.
We analyzed and compared different open-source libraries and tools.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:python_projects_libraries} shows a screenshot of a subset of our internal comparison.
We refrain from exploring and discussing our findings to avoid bloating the thesis.
Especially because this landscape is constantly changing, and better options might exist since our analysis. 
We carefully considered every dependency that FLOps relies upon.
The dependency listings are available in the codebase \cite{flops_code}.

    % very brief overview how many there are
    % mention how large these dependencies and images are

    \subsection{Image Builders}
    % Need for Buildah vs Docker

    \subsection{Multi Platform}

    \subsection{FLOps Image Builder Details}
    % How does FLOps builds its image concretely
    % base images
    % also mention how trained images are build - mlflow + dockerfiles + buildah

\section{Local Data Management}
% explain in detail how this works
% mention mock data providers
% mention apache arrow, parquet, flight
% reuse/augment existing graphics

\section{MLOps via MLflow}

    \subsection{MLOps Components \& Architecture}
        % Explain how the MLOps architecture works in FLOps
        % Tracking Server as Proxy for storages, etc.
        % Explain how and where the results are stored

    \subsection{GUI}
        % Showcase how the GUI looks like and how it can be used

\section{Clustered HFL}
    % Explain in detail how this novel approach works

\section{CLI}
    % brief overview, etc - maybe even a use case model, etc.
