\section{Results}

% Base Case Analysis
% CPU, Memory, Disk, Network, Stages,
% introduce & explain graphs that will be used, etc.
% discuss "run duration diffs" - need for normalization
% also mention different project sizes, etc - and why this is only scratching the surface
\subsection{Basics}

% image build related 
% - speeds 
% - sizes 
% - cache 
% - baseimages 
% - multiplatform
\subsection{Image Builder}

% depens how much progress I can make here besides already established pytorch
\subsection{Different ML Frameworks/Libraries \& Datasets}

% HFL on monolith
% non-HFL (base-case) on multi-cluster
% HFL on multi-cluster
% diff HFL configurations & discussion
