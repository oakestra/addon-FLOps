\section{Results}

We split our findings into the following subsections.
The basics explain and showcase the simplest base-case and what graphs we use to visualize our findings for all experiments.
Afterward, we analyze how different variables change the image build processes.
Penultimately, we discuss how different ML repositories, frameworks and datasets perform in FLOps.
Lastly, we focus on HFL and verify that our custom novel solution is sound.

\subsection{Image Builder}
TODO

% depens how much progress I can make here besides already established pytorch
\subsection{Different ML Frameworks/Libraries \& Datasets}

% HFL on monolith
% non-HFL (base-case) on multi-cluster
% HFL on multi-cluster
% diff HFL configurations & discussion

% DONT forget to inlcude the proof of concept here first!
