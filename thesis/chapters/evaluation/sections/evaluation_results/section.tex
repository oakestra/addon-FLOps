\section{Results}

We split our findings into the following subsections.
The basics explain and showcase the simplest base-case and what graphs we use to visualize our findings for all experiments.
Afterward, we analyze how different variables change the image build processes.
Penultimately, we discuss how different ML repositories, frameworks and datasets perform in FLOps.
Lastly, we focus on HFL and verify that our custom novel solution is sound.

% HFL on monolith
% non-HFL (base-case) on multi-cluster
% HFL on multi-cluster
% diff HFL configurations & discussion

% DONT forget to inlcude the proof of concept here first!
