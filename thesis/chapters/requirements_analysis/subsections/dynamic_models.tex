\subsection{Dynamic Model}
%TODO paraphraze
"The dynamic model focuses on the behavior of the system. The dynamic model is
depicted with sequence diagrams and with state machines. Sequence diagrams represent the
interactions among a set of objects during a single use case. State machines represent the
behavior of a single object (or a group of very tightly coupled objects). The dynamic model
serves to assign responsibilities to individual classes and, in the process, to identify new classes,
associations, and attributes to be added to the analysis object model."
